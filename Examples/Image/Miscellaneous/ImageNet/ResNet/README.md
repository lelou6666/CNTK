# CNTK example: ImageNet ResNet 

**Disclaimer: network configurations and experiment settings in this this folder try to follow those published in the [ResNet paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) as close as possible. However, these samples are NOT endorsed or verified by the researchers who published the original work. It is NOT guaranteed that you get the same (or even close) results as those in the paper.**

## Overview

|Data:     |The ILSVRC2012 dataset (http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/) of images.
|:---------|:---
|Purpose   |This example demonstrates usage of the NDL (Network Description Language) to define networks similar to ResNet.
|Network   |NDLNetworkBuilder, deep convolutional networks resembling ResNet networks.
|Training  |Stochastic gradient descent with momentum.
