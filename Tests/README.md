# Unit tests and end-to-end tests

The unit tests and end-to-end tests provided in this folder are run as part 
of the checkin workflow on the build server. You can run all tests locally 
to verify that your code changes didn't break any test.

How to run unit tests and end-to-end test is described in the CNTK wiki on github at
